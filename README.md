  This project is meant to help created a professional Readme for users by taking in several details from command line prompts.  The questions all help generate the information throughout the readme file and specify when questions are required for a user to answer. It generates the readme name based on the title.  It takes in license information and generates badges at the top of the Readme next to the title.  It asks for languages used, special installation and usage information, contribution names and provides a link to the contribution code.  Lastly it asks for any special tests conducted throughout to help ensure the code works correctly.  It also has a contact section at the bottom with github repo and email link.
